## Notes

- Passwords are stored locally in a plain text file (`passwords.txt`).
- If the file does not exist, it will be created automatically.
- Weak passwords such as `123456`, `password`, or `qwerty` are not recommended.
- The program estimates entropy but does not yet calculate mathematical entropy (`logâ‚‚` of combinations).
